# Study Buddy Blog
This is my project called Study Buddy Blog. It is aimed towards teenagers who going through exams upto university students.

[You can view the live project here](https://study-buddy-blog-01ab6e2c45d9.herokuapp.com/)

### Project Goals:
The aim was to create a minimalist blog post website to provide insight, tips and trick  into studying. We have the CRUD functionality, where the usess are able to create comments, read comments, Update (or Edit) comments and delete comments. 

### Methodology
This project used the Agile Methodology. The Kanban Boards on Github were used to organise User Stories and Epics. Furthermore, labels of must, should, won't fix and maybe not. 

### User Stories
Each Epic is made up of some User Stories

- **Epic-Admin/Authorization**
  - Account Sign Up 
  - Manage Posts
  - Create Drafts
  + Add Own posts
 
- **Epic-View**
  
  - See the post (on landing page)
  - Read the post (when you click)
- **Epic-Comments**
  
  - Edit Comments
  - Comment Compliance
  - Commenting
  - View Comments
- **Epic-Likes**
  
  + View Likes
  + Like a post
  + Unlike 

The User Stories with an + are not implemented. 

You can find the project board [here]()

1. Add own posts was not implemented at this stage due to time constraints
2. The likes were removed due to the fact that this is aimed at teenagers. Whilst conversation is encouraged, this website is not just about who can have the most popular blog post. It is not designed for competition. Rather it is to students study and move into university. Eventually, this blog site will be available to many authorised users who can make their own posts. Therefore, it has potential to become a site only concerned about bringing in likes especially since it will be opened to many poeple in the future.
